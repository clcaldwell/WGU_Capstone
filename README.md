**Generated Files**\
The following files were automatically generated via Entity Framework scaffolding. EF scaffolding is where Entity Framework connects to the specified DB and creates C# classes matching the available fields in the database.
Generated Scaffold Files:\
`/Model/DBEntities/Address.cs`\
`/Model/DBEntities/Appointment.cs`\
`/Model/DBEntities/City.cs`\
`/Model/DBEntities/Country.cs`\
`/Model/DBEntities/Customer.cs`\
`/Model/DBEntities/User.cs`\
`/Services/DBContext.cs`

**gitignore Template File**\
The `.gitignore` file was taken from a standard template available for Visual Studio projects available from GitHub. This has no effect on the project itself, it simply makes it easier to manage the project with git, by ignoring Visual Studio artifacts that do not need to be indexed.
